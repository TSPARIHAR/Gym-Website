## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

List any software that needs to be installed before running the project. For example:

* Node.js and npm (if it's a JavaScript-based project)
* Python and pip (if it's a Python-based project)
* A database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and set up the project. For example:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TSPARIHAR/Gym-Website.git](https://github.com/TSPARIHAR/Gym-Website.git)
    cd Gym-Website
    ```
2.  Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    cd frontend  # Or the relevant frontend directory
    npm install   # Or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```
3.  Install backend dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    cd backend  # Or the relevant backend directory
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or npm install, composer install, etc.
    cd ..
    ```
4.  Set up the database:
    * Create a database schema (if necessary).
    * Configure database connection details (e.g., in a `.env` file or configuration file).
    * Run migrations (if applicable):

        # Example for Django
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

## Usage

Explain how to run the website after installation. For example:

1.  Start the backend server (if applicable):
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python manage.py runserver  # Or node server.js, php artisan serve, etc.
    cd ..
    ```
2.  Start the frontend development server (if applicable):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start   # Or yarn start
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to the specified address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend, `http://localhost:8000` for the backend).
